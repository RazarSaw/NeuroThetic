# NueroThetic

The NeuroThetic is a mechanical prosthetic arm controlled by EEG waves from the Muse S. This project was forked from [Alexandre Barachant](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl)'s original muse-lsl repository. It processes EEG signals to produce movement in servos, which in turn control a larger arm. The arm is created with 3D printed components.

The premise of this project is to create a mind controlled prosthetic arm, that is affordable in comparison to the current market in prosthetics. Additionally, this project was also initally created as a participant for the F.W. Johnson STEAM Academy's *STEAM Fair*.
